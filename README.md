My own LCARS dashboard for Home Assistant


Hi All.

I made a custom LCARS dashboard for Home Assistant.

Here is what I used to make this dashboard:


HACS 

HA LCARS https://github.com/th3jesta/ha-lcars

CB-LCARS https://github.com/snootched/cb-lcars

custom-button-card https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card

slider-card https://github.com/AnthonMS/my-cards

Lovelace-layout-card https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card

Lovelace-card-mod https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod


The HA theme I am using is LCARS Transporter (part of HA LCARS)
